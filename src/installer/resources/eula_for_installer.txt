End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement (the “EULA”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single legal entity) and Reusabit Software LLC (“Reusabit”), which covers your use of Prozezzor.

By explicitly accepting this EULA you are acknowledging and agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions:

The Software, as that term is defined herein, is licensed, not sold.  Use of the Software is subject to license restrictions.  Copying, installing, or use of the Software indicates complete and unconditional acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth in this EULA.

This binary package contains software and associated documentation files (the “Application”) developed by Reusabit Software LLC, bundled together with its dependencies (the “Dependencies”). This EULA pertains to the Application and those of the Dependencies which Reusabit has the actual right to distribute or sublicense (the “Covered Dependencies”) according to the terms of this EULA (collectively, the “Software”). The remainder of the Dependencies are distributed under their respective licenses (the “Uncovered Dependencies”), some of which might grant additional rights, or obligations, to you (which pertain only to that Dependency). Specifically, the Install4J redistributables are a part of the Covered Dependencies, and the bundled Java Development Kit (JDK) is a part of the Uncovered Dependencies, and is distributed under its GPL license.  The Licensed Dependencies and Unlicensed Dependencies make up the Dependencies. For more information about Dependencies and to obtain source code to which you are entitled, email oss@reusabit.com.

Note that the Application’s source code (without the bundled installer and Dependencies) might be available to you under a separate open-source license. See https://github.com/reusabit/prozezzor for more information.
